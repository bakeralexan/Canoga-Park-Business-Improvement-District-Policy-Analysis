# Canoga-Park-Business-Improvement-District-Policy-Analysis

This project examines the conditions of businesses in the Canoga Park Business Improvement District (BID) during the spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Canoga Park is a neighborhood within District 3 in the City of Los Angeles. A BID is an organization of commercial property owners that manages a certain area and provides services that benefit businesses including marketing, beautification, maintenance, and security. Because of impacts from the pandemic, many businesses in the Canoga Park BID closed temporarily or permanently and many suffered a diminishment of clientele. Phone and online surveys were administered to 130 businesses along the Sherman Way corridor from Glade Street to Canoga Avenue; 96 respondents replied. Data from an additional 17 businesses was found online for a total of 113 businesses with data in our study. In the sample, 86 businesses were confirmed to be open and 35 were closed in some form, resulting in financial burden for commercial property owners and a 10 to 12% decrease in tax revenue generated from the Sherman Way Corridor for the City of LA. When asked about what support small business owners would need during COVID, overwhelmingly, businesses wanted methods to increase clientele to the area. Additionally, among business owners, few were familiar with the existence or services of the BID. To increase the efficiency of support offered by the BID, the first option is to use enhanced marketing strategies including a pandemic specific e-newsletter, social media marketing campaigns, and a consumer-centric, redesigned BID website with an online directory of open businesses. The fiscal impact of this option could range between $2,000 to $5,000 if a professional is hired to redesign the website and $7.19 cost per a thousand impressions (CPM) and $600 CPM for Facebook and Yelp advertising respectively. The BID can avoid these costs if it chooses to do the labor itself. The second option entails using small business improvement strategies including workshops, the Al Fresco Initiative for restaurants, and physical signage to indicate currently open businesses. The anticipated costs for this option would be the labor cost and cost of signage ranging from $2,200 to $3,000. The last option is to continue the BIDâ€™s current strategies without making changes to existing ones. There are no extraneous costs associated with this option outside of the potential continued loss of revenue. The recommendation is to enact option one because it enhances communication with and supports all stakeholders including consumers. It also poses potential benefits outside of COVID.
